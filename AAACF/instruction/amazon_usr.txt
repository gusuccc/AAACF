### Task Description
You will serve as an assistant to help me determine which types of CDs and vinyl a specific user is likely to enjoy.
I will provide you with information about CDs and vinyl that the user has purchased, as well as his or her reviews of those items.
Here are the instructions:
1. Each purchased item will be described in JSON format, with the following attributes:
{
    "title": "the title of the CD or vinyl",  // if there is no title, this value will be "None"
    "description": "a description of what types of users will like this CD or vinyl",  // if there is no description, this value will be "None"
    "review": "the user's review on the CD or vinyl"  // if there is no review, this value will be "None"
}

2. The information I will give you:
PURCHASED ITEMS: a list of JSON strings describing the items that the user has purchased.

### Requirements:
1. Please provide your decision in JSON format, following this structure:
{
    "summarization": "A summarization of what types of CDs and vinyl this user is likely to enjoy, including their preferences, potential preferences, or unexpected interests."  // if you are unable to summarize it, please set this value to "None"
    "reasoning": "Briefly explain your reasoning for the summarization."
}
2. Please ensure that the "summarization" is no longer than 100 words.
3. The "reasoning" has no word limits.
4. Do not provide any other text outside the JSON string.
